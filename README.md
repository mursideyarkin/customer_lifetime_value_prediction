## customer_lifetime_value_prediction
The main purpose of this repository is to model and forecast customer lifetime value.

Customer lifetime value (CLTV or CLV) can be defined as the present value of a customer for the company based on projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. CLTV represents the total amount of money spent on the business or products over lifetime of a customer.

In this notebook, I'll try to apply a BTYD model on an online retail dataset to make a 1-year CLTV prediction.
