## Project Purpose:

The main purpose of this repository is to model and forecast customer lifetime value (CLTV or CLV) for a company.


## The Buy Till You Die Models:

The Buy Till You Die (BTYD) class of statistical models is designed to **predict** the behavioral characteristics of customers. 

Customer lifetime value can be defined as the **present value of a customer** for the company **based on projected future cash flows** from the customer relationship. CLTV represents the total amount of money spent on the business or products over lifetime of a customer.

In this notebook, I'll try to apply a BTYD model on an online retail dataset to make a 1-year CLTV prediction.

## Data set:

online_retail_II.xlsx: The data set includes the sales of a UK-based online store between 01/12/2009 - 09/12/2011. The product catalog of this company is mostly souvenirs. It can also be considered as promotional products.
